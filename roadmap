- For your daemon’s log, you will have to create a class called Tintin_reporter (you
will be able to re-use it in future projects)
- Every daemon action should show in a log file matt_daemon.log with timestamp
(in this form [ DD / MM / YYYY - HH : MM : SS]) located in the folder /var/log/-
matt_daemon/. You can create several logs if you like.



- The daemon will have to listen to the port 4242.
- Only one daemon instance should be able to run at once. When attempting to run a second daemon whereas one instance is already running,
an error message indicating a creation/file opening on matt_daemon.lock attempt
must pop. A matt_daemon.lock file must be created in /var/lock/ when the daemon starts.
When the daemon shuts down, the matt_daemon.lock file must be deleted.


- The program must quit with the sending of a simple "quit" character chain on the
opened socket.
• Any other character chain must be registered in the log file.
• Only 3 clients can connect simultaneously to the daemon.
• When the daemon receives a signal, it must intercept it and register it in the
matt_daemon.log file with an explicit message and quit properly.
